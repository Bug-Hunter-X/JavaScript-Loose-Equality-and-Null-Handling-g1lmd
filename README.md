# JavaScript Loose Equality and Null Handling
This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error related to loose equality (==) and the handling of null values. Loose equality can lead to unexpected behavior when comparing values of different types, especially with null.

## The Problem
JavaScript's loose equality operator (==) does type coercion before comparison. This can lead to unexpected results.  For example, `0 == false` evaluates to `true`, and `null == undefined` also evaluates to `true`.  This can be problematic when dealing with null values where you explicitly need to check if a variable is null.

## The Solution
The most reliable way to handle null values is to use strict equality (===) and perform explicit checks for null.  This avoids the type coercion issues.
